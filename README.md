# Simple Weather Forcasting Model

### Introduction 

Weather forecast is essential in modern society. People acquire weather information every day and everywhere to make plans on traveling and events. Weather forecasting helps people be prepared when a storm comes. In Iowa and some other agricultural states, weather is also significant in agricultural production, plotting time, spraying time, and harvest time, all determined by weather. 

This program aims at predicting the weather conditions in Ames, including but not limited to temperature, relative humidity, “feels like” temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility, on an hourly basis.

### Data Preprocessing

Although weather data is abundant, finding the right range of data that fits the specific problem sometimes can be challenging. In this project, the weather data are acquired from Iowa Environmental Mesonet’s ASOS Network. The range of data is from December 1, 2018 to December 1, 2019. The data is aquired in the format of txt files, and they were recorded on an hourly or half-hourly basis.

Here a link to my Python Notebooks. 

### Data Analysis

The models that are used in this project include Random Forest Model linear regression model, Sciki linear regression model, SVM polynomial model. 

There are six weather factors in the dataset: air temperature (F), relative humidity (%), "feel-like" temperature, wind speed, hourly p recipitation, and visibility.
